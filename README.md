# Web Development Quiz:
## JavaScript Edition. 

&nbsp;





### Project Description:

&nbsp;

For this project I created a multiple choice quiz on the topic of JavaScript. An individual who takes this quiz is given 90 seconds at the start, and is presented with seven questions total. If they get a question wrong, they will have ten seconds subtracted from the clock. At the end of the quiz, they are given the opportunity to enter their initials, and save their high score. They can attempt the quiz again, in an effort to answer all of the questions correctly, and have a larger time amount left on the clock, and stored in the archive. The user can click the high scores tab, at the top of the screen, to view their best times. This quiz application was constructed using a single HTML file, two JavaScript files, and a CSS file. I utilized the Bootstrap CDN for some elements, and worked with a contemporary font named "Work Sans" that was obtained through google fonts and designed by Wei Huang, a type designer from Australia.
